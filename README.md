# Survey Project

This is a survey project implemented in Python. The project analyzes survey data and generates histograms based on different survey questions.

## Description

The survey project allows you to analyze survey data and generate histograms for various survey questions. The survey data is stored in a CSV file named "Survey.csv". The project uses the `pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries to read the survey data and visualize it using histograms.

## Main Menu

The main menu of the project provides the following options:

1. Histogram

## Histogram

The histogram option allows you to select a specific survey question and generate a histogram based on the responses. The available histogram options are based of the responses by students from all over the world which was collected via google forms and histograms made using the csv file:

1. Surveyers Age Group
2. Surveyers Gender Identity
3. Surveyers Current academic position or Affiliation
4. Surveryers Field
5. Surveyers Continent
6. Have you ever experimented with ChatGPT?
7. What did you use ChatGPT for?
8. Do you think ChatGPT is plagiarism in and of itself?
9. The use of AI tools such as ChatGPT would inhibit education
10. Students should use the assistance of ChatGPT for University assignments ethically?
11. Should universities allow students to use ChatGPT?

To generate a histogram, select the corresponding option by entering the number and follow the prompts. The histogram will be displayed using the `matplotlib` library.

## Getting Started

To run the survey project, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, ensure that the `pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries are installed. You can install them using the following command:


Once you have set up the environment, run the Python script `survey_project.py` to start the project.

## Data Format

The survey data should be stored in a CSV file named "Survey.csv". The file should contain columns corresponding to different survey questions, such as "Age Group", "Gender", "Affiliation", "Field", "Continent", "ChatGPT", "CGPT Plagiarism", "Use AI Tools", "ChGPT for University", "University Allow", and "Usage".
